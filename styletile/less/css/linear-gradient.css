Gradient mixin
====================================================
The mixins provides you a cross-browser compatible method to set a linear gradient which goes from top to bottom.

Please refer to <http://caniuse.com/css-gradients> to see the browser support table of the feature.

Shopware 5 also provides gradient mixins based on the basic color variables that can be changed in the backend theme configuration tool.
######Basic gradients:
`.primary-gradient();`<br/>
`.secondary-gradient();`<br/>
`.white-gradient();`<br/>

######Linear Gradient Example:
`.linear-gradient([startcolor-value], [endcolor-value]);`

`@param {String} start The start color of the gradient`<br/>
`@param {String} end The end color of the gradient`
